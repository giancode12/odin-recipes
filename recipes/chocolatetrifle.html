    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Trifle is already a quintessential potluck dish because it’s simple to prepare. Fun fact: When it first debuted, trifle was a much more complicated dish reserved for elites, but thanks to cooking innovations like boxed cake and pudding mix and tubs of whipped topping, it’s become a much simpler dessert better suited to the masses.
